# Unity Endless Runner
A simple 3D endless runner made in Unity using C#.
Current Features:
1)Player movement using transform.translate().
2)Player following first person camera.
3)RigidBody Collisons.
4)Jumping mechanic.
5)Score display.
6)Win/Lose Scenario
Problems:
1)NOT endless(despite the name, sorry), so i'll have to implement procedurally generated levels
Things I want to add:
1)Enemy NPCs(may imlement some sort of AI or a just a simple standard unidirectional movement thing) that moves in a direction opposite to player.
2)Ability to shoot the enemy NPCs
Deadline for completion: 29 October 2018
